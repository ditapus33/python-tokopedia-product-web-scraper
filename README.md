# üõçÔ∏è Tokopedia Product Web Scraper

This project is a **Python-based web scraping tool** that extracts product information such as **title**, **price**, and **date** from a Tokopedia product page.  
It uses the **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests** libraries to fetch and parse HTML content from the website.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- Connect to a Tokopedia product URL using the `requests` library.
- Extract specific HTML elements (product name and price) using `BeautifulSoup`.
- Store the collected data into a **CSV file**.
- Automate daily scraping with a time delay using the `time` library.
- (Optional) Send an **email notification** when the price drops below a certain threshold.

The project can serve as a starting point for building e-commerce monitoring or price-tracking applications.

# üß† How It Works
* **Step 1 ‚Äî Import Libraries**

  Import all required Python libraries for scraping, time handling, and file writing.

* **Step 2 ‚Äî Connect to the Website**

  Use the Requests library to send an HTTP request to the Tokopedia product page using proper headers.

* **Step 3 ‚Äî Parse the HTML Content**

  Feed the page content into BeautifulSoup to structure and extract HTML tags.

* **Step 4 ‚Äî Extract Product Information**

  Find and extract:

  * Product Title ‚Üí `<h1>` tag with `data-testid="lblPDPDetailProductName"`

  * Product Price ‚Üí `<div>` tag with `data-testid="lblPDPDetailProductPrice"`

* **Step 5 ‚Äî Save Data to CSV**

  Store the extracted title, price, and current date in a `.csv file`.

* **Step 6 ‚Äî Automate the Scraping**

  Run the scraping function every 24 hours (`86400 seconds`) to check for updated prices.

* **Step 7 ‚Äî Optional: Send Email Notification**

  Send yourself an alert email when the product price drops below a chosen threshold.
